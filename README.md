## Big-O notation

Formal definition: $T(n) = O(f(n))$ if and only if there exist $c, n_0 > 0$, such that $T(n) \leq cf(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.


## Omega notation

Formal definition: $T(n) = \Omega(f(n))$ if and only if there exist $c, n_0 > 0$, such that $T(n) \geq cf(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

## Theta notation

Formal definition: $T(n)=\theta(f(n))$ if and only if $T(n)=O(f(n))$ and $T(n)=\Omega(f(n))$. 
there exist $c_1, c_2$, such that $T(n) \geq c_1 f(n)$ and $T(n) \leq c_2 f(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

## Counting inversions

Couting inversion means that 

 $i, j$ form an inversion if $a_i > a_j$, that is, if the two elements $a_i$ and $a_j$ are "out of order".

Finding "similarity" between two rankings. Given a sequence of n numbers 1..n (assume all numbers are distinct). Define a measure that tells us how far this list is from being in ascending order.  The value should be 0 if $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n$ and 
should be higher as the list is more "out of order".
